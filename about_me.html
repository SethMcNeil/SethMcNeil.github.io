        <p>I am Seth McNeil, and I live in Fort McMurray. I made this page for a class in school. I live with my parents and brothers. My hobbies include video games, reading books and playing board games with my family. In the summer months, I like to ride my bike on trails.</p>
        <p>Fun Fact about my hometown: Fort McMurray is a small city with large deposits of oil nearby. Most of our economy is determined by the oil market and many peoples jobs are tied to the oil sands.</p>
